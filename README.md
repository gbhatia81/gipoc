## setup
```
make setup
```

## steps to run the code in local
1. Make sure setup is done
2. Use gcloud to authenticate ``` gcloud auth login ```
3. Run ``` python gipoc.py ```
   

## steps to run the code in Google Env like Collab and Workspace
Instead of using gcloud auth, we just need to provide right permissions to worker/runner - TBD
