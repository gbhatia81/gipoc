       " Document(page_content='1PART I Introduction This report is our 2022 annual report to shareholders and our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, or 2022 Form 10-K. Omnicom Group Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1986, through its branded networks and agencies provides  advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to over 5,000 clients in more than 70 countries. The terms  “Omnicom,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Omnicom Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context  indicates otherwise. Item 1. Business Our Business Omnicom is a strategic holding company providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to many  of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB, TBWA, Omnicom Media  Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks integrate  their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including the Omnicom Health Group, the Omnicom Precision  Marketing Group, the Omnicom Commerce Group, the Omnicom Advertising Collective, the Omnicom Public Relations Group,  and the Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution & Support businesses, which  includes the Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group. We operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global, national and regional advertising and  marketing services companies, as well as technology, social media and professional services companies. The proliferation of media  channels, including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and media, has fragmented consumer  audiences targeted by our clients. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a  cost-effective way, causing them to turn to global service providers such as Omnicom for a customized mix of advertising and  marketing services designed to optimize their total marketing expenditure. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our networks, practice areas and agencies provide a comprehensive range of  services in the following fundamental disciplines: Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting,  Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations and Healthcare. Advertising & Media includes creative services across digital  and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media and data analytics services. Precision Marketing  includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting and data and analytics. Commerce & Brand Consulting  services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research, retail marketing and ecommerce marketing. Experiential  marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution & Support includes field  marketing, digital and physical merchandising, point-of-sale and product placement, as well as other specialized marketing and  custom communications services. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis management, public affairs  and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media services to  global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. As a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications  company, we operate in all major markets. Our geographic markets include: the Americas, which includes North America and  Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific. Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies  operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our  fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our  service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom  collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration  allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and  comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing  clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary  companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that currently serve or could serve our existing clients. In addition to  collaborating through our client service models, our agencies and networks collaborate across internally developed technology  platforms. Annalect and Omni, our proprietary data and analytics platforms, serve as the strategic resource for all of our agencies  and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks. These platforms provide precision  marketing and insights at scale across creative, media and other disciplines. Driven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities, we strive to provide an  extensive range of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services through various client-centric networks that are  organized to meet specific client objectives.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2Our service offerings include: advertising marketing research branding media planning and buying content marketing retail media planning and buying corporate social responsibility consulting merchandising and point of sale crisis communications mobile marketing custom publishing multi-cultural marketing data analytics non-profit marketing database management organizational communications digital/direct marketing and post-production services package design digital transformation consulting product placement entertainment marketing promotional marketing experiential marketing public affairs field marketing public relations financial/corporate business-to-business advertising retail marketing graphic arts/digital imaging retail media and ecommerce healthcare marketing and communications search engine marketing instore design shopper marketing interactive marketing social media marketing investor relations sports and event marketing Certain business trends have impacted our business and industry. These trends include clients increasingly expanding  the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and integrating traditional and  non-traditional marketing channels, as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms. As  clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency, they tend to continue to consolidate their business  within one or a small number of service providers in the pursuit of a single engagement covering all consumer touch points.  We have structured our business around these trends. We believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to  collaboration and integration of our services and solutions have provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and  we expect this to continue over the medium and long term. Our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client  management and allows for greater integration across our service platforms. Our overarching strategy is to continue to use our  virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks, disciplines  and geographies. We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities, as well as to  identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses for disposition. For information about our acquisitions and dispositions, see  Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, - Acquisitions and  Goodwill and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, none of our  acquisitions or dispositions, individually or in the aggregate, was material to our results of operations or financial position. The various components of our business, including revenue by discipline and geographic area, and material factors that  affected us in the three years ended December 31, 2022, are discussed in the MD&A. Our Clients Our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy. In many cases, multiple agencies or networks serve  different brands, product groups or both within the same client. For example, in 2022, our largest client represented 2.7% of  revenue and was served by approximately 90 of our agencies. Our 100 largest clients, many of which represent the largest global  companies, represented approximately 53% of revenue and were each served, on average, by approximately 54 of our agencies.  Although we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns. Government Regulations We are subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct business.  Compliance with these laws and regulations in the normal course of business did not have a material effect on our business, results  of operations or financial position. Additional information regarding the impact of government regulations on our business is  included in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulatory Risks.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3Human Capital Resources and Environmental Sustainability Initiatives Our employees are our most important assets. We believe a critical component of our success depends on the ability to  attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar.  Common to all is the ability to understand a client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and to develop a unique message  to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience, whether through traditional channels or emerging  digital platforms. Recognizing the importance of this core competency, we support and develop our employees through training  and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. Human capital management strategies are developed collectively by senior management, including the management teams  of our networks, practice areas, and agencies, and are overseen by our Board of Directors. We are committed to efforts that ensure  that the workplace is equitable, ethical, fosters an inclusive work environment across our global workforce and respects human  rights. Our social and human capital management priorities include, among other things, adopting codes of conduct and business  ethics, providing competitive wages and benefits, comprehensive training programs, succession planning, promoting diversity and  inclusion and implementing programs that prioritize the achievement of systemic equity throughout our organization. At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 74,200 people worldwide, including 31,500 people in the Americas,  27,500 people in EMEA, and 15,200 people in Asia Pacific. Our largest employee base is the United States, where we employed  approximately 25,600 people. None of our regular employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain  countries outside the United States, primarily in Europe, some employees are represented by work councils. See the MD&A for a  discussion of the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations. Our environmental sustainability initiatives focus on efficiency of office space, energy usage and travel. In connection with  our environmental sustainability efforts, we are a signatory to the UN Global Compact, a principle-based framework to encourage  businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies. We support the UN Sustainable Development  Goals, a collection of global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better, more inclusive and sustainable future. Also, we are  committed to joining the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which publicly audits companies on their emissions reduction  efforts.

       " Document(page_content='4Item 1A. Risk Factors Economic Risks Adverse economic conditions, a reduction in client spending, a deterioration in the credit markets or a delay in client  payments could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Macroeconomic conditions have a direct impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. Adverse  economic conditions, including high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain issues affecting the distribution of  our clients’ products, or a disruption in the credit markets, pose a risk that clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on  advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects. Such actions would reduce the demand for our services and could  result in a reduction in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. A  contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements. In addition, a  disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our clients liquidity and could cause them to delay payment for our services  or take other actions that would negatively affect our working capital. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional  financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we  take action to respond to adverse economic conditions, reductions in revenue and disruptions in the credit markets by aligning our  cost structure and more efficiently managing our working capital, such actions may not be effective. A period of sustained inflation across all the major markets in which we operate could result in higher operating costs. Our principal operating expenses are salary and service costs and occupancy and related costs. Inflationary pressures typically  result in increases to our operating expenses. In cases of sustained inflation across several of our major markets, it becomes  increasingly difficult to effectively control increases to our costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers budgets could  result in the reduction of our clients’ spending plans on the advertising, marketing and communication services we provide. If  we are unable to increase our fees or take other actions to mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, our business, results of  operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. In an economic downturn, the risk of a material loss related to media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf  of our clients could significantly increase, and methods for managing or mitigating such risk may be less available or  unavailable. In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production  companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are  included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by  local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a  disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and  certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not  liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by  our client for the media or production services. Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of  sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly, and such a loss  could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in  advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be insufficient, less available, or  unavailable during a severe economic downturn. The war in Ukraine has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position, and could adversely  impact our business, results of operations and financial position in the future. Historically, we conducted operations in Russia and Ukraine through local agencies in which we held a majority stake. During  the first quarter of 2022, the war in Ukraine required us to suspend our business operations in Ukraine, and we disposed of all of  our businesses in Russia. The war in Ukraine is ongoing and its duration is uncertain. We cannot predict the outcome of the war in Ukraine or its  impact on the broader region, as the conflict and related government actions are evolving and are beyond our control. The extent  and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, which may include increased energy costs and  further supply chain disruptions, could be significant and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial  position in the future. Our clients’ businesses, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely impacted by the  war in Ukraine, which could impact client spending on our services.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position, and the COVID-19  pandemic or other similar public health crises could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial  position in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial position beginning in  2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021. Global economic conditions may continue to be uncertain as long as  the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar public health crises, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, remain or  become a public health threat. Demand for certain of our services may be adversely affected by government measures, including  restrictions on travel and business operation and quarantine and stay-at-home orders arising from a recurrence of a pandemic,  or similar public health crises. The extent of the impact on our business will depend on numerous factors that we are not able to  accurately predict, including the geographic regions that may be affected. Business and Operational Risks Clients periodically review and change their advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements and  relationships. If we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients, our business, results of operations and financial  position may be adversely affected. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Key competitive considerations for retaining existing clients and winning  new clients include our ability to develop solutions that meet client needs in a rapidly changing environment, the quality and  effectiveness of our services and our ability to serve clients efficiently, particularly large multinational clients, on a broad geographic  basis. From time to time, clients may put their advertising, marketing and corporate communications business up for competitive  review. We have won and lost accounts as a result of these reviews. To the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or  retain key clients, our revenue may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of  operations and financial position. Acquiring new clients and retaining existing clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising  from other client relationships, retaining key personnel and maintaining a highly skilled workforce. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients’ perceptions of, or  policies concerning, conflicts of interest arising from other client relationships. If we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to  manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests, our business, results of operations and financial  position may be adversely affected. As a service business, our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness. If we are  unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to provide our services in the manner clients have come to expect may be  adversely affected, which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our  business, results of operations and financial position. The loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and  financial position. In 2022, our 100 largest clients represented approximately 53% of our revenue. Clients generally are able to reduce or cancel  current or future spending on advertising, marketing and corporate communications projects at any time on short notice for any  reason. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, if not  replaced by new clients or an increase in business from existing clients, would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material  adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. We rely extensively on information technology systems, and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us. We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure to connect with our clients, people and others, and to store  and process business and financial data. Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, including computer viruses, hacking and  ransomware attacks, are constantly evolving and pose a risk to our systems and networks. Security breaches, improper use of our  systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be  exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject  to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes may be unable to prevent material security breaches, and such breaches  could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and reputation. Our third-party service providers, including cloud providers, store, transmit and process data. These third-party service  providers are also subject to malicious attacks and cybersecurity threats that could adversely affect us.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='6In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic many of our employees worked from home for all or part of the time.  Currently, many agencies continue to operate on a hybrid work schedule where employees are working from home part of the  time. The number of employees working from home varies by market and is dependent on local conditions. The increase in the  number of employees working from home may increase certain business and process control risks, including increased risk of  cybersecurity incidents and exposure of sensitive business and client advertising and marketing information, as well as personal data  or information. Risks Related to International Operations Currency exchange rate fluctuations have impacted, and in the future could impact, our business, results of operations and  financial position. In 2022, our international operations represented approximately 48% of our revenue. We operate in all major international  markets including the Euro Zone, the United Kingdom, or the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and Japan. Our agencies  transact business in more than 50 different currencies. Substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local  currency and, accordingly, their financial statements are translated into U.S. Dollars. As a result, both adverse and beneficial  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, funds  transferred to the United States can be adversely or beneficially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a global business we face certain risks of doing business internationally, and we are exposed to risks from operating  in high-growth markets and developing countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of  operations and financial position. The operational and financial performance of our international businesses are affected by global and regional economic  conditions, competition for new business and staff, currency exchange rate fluctuations, political conditions, differing tax and  regulatory environments and other risks associated with extensive international operations. In addition, we conduct business in  numerous high-growth markets and developing countries that tend to have longer billing collection cycles, currency repatriation  restrictions and commercial laws that can be undeveloped, vague, inconsistently enforced, retroactively applied or frequently  changed. The risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of  operations and financial position. Additionally, our operations are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and  other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and stringent, and any changes  and violations could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. For financial information by geographic region, see  Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Risks Related to Acquisitions We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions. We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs. As  part of the process, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence to identify and evaluate material risks involved in any  particular transaction. Despite our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. As a result, the  intended advantages of any given acquisition may not be realized. If we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more  acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. Our goodwill is an intangible asset that may become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,  results of operations and financial position. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP , we have recorded  a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions; a substantial portion of which represents the intangible specialized  know-how of the acquired workforce. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we review the carrying value  of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying  value may not be recoverable. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection  with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. While we have concluded, for  each year presented in the financial statements included in this report, that our goodwill is not impaired, future events could cause  us to conclude that the intangible asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting non-cash  impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='7Regulatory Risks Government regulation and consumer advocates may limit the scope and content of our services, which could affect our  ability to meet our clients’ needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and  financial position. Government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope, content and manner  of presentation of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services, through regulation or other governmental  action, which could affect our ability to meet our clients’ needs. Such regulation may seek, among other things, to limit the tax  deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services. In addition, there has been a  tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices and claims, which could cause  our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services. Any regulatory or judicial action that affects our ability  to meet our clients’ needs or reduces client spending on our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of  operations and financial position. Laws and regulations related to user privacy, use of personal information and Internet tracking technologies have been  proposed or enacted in the United States and a number of international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the  acceptance of new communications technologies and the use of current communications technologies as advertising media. These  actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our  business, results of operations and financial position. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, reputational  harm and other unforeseen adverse effects on our business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on  environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions,  human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals  and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our  Corporate Responsibility Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of  these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties and requires ongoing investments. The success of our goals and initiatives  may be impacted by factors that are outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives  and the focus and views of stakeholders may change and evolve over time and vary depending on the jurisdictions in which we  operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements,  comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and  varied stakeholder expectations and views could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial  position and stock price.

The facility requirements of our businesses are similar  across geographic regions and disciplines. Substantially all our office space is leased under operating leases with varying expiration  dates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Risks and Uncertainties Current global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the lingering effects of the COVID-19  pandemic, high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions could cause economic uncertainty  and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic  conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to  align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to  the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client  revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments. Impact of the War in Ukraine Historically, we conducted operations in Russia and Ukraine through local agencies in which we held a majority stake.  During the first quarter of 2022, the war in Ukraine required us to suspend our business operations in Ukraine. The war resulted  in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affected the cross-border  operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, Russian regulators imposed currency restrictions and regulations. All of  these actions created uncertainty regarding our ability to recover our investment in our operations in Russia, as well as our ability to  exercise control over the operations. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia was uncertain. As a result, we disposed  of all of our businesses in Russia. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pretax charges of $113.4 million, which  primarily consisted of the net investment in our Russian businesses, and included charges related to the suspension of operations in  Ukraine. Lingering Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected global economic activity. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through  the first quarter of 2021, our business was impacted by reductions in client spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While  mixed by business and geography, the spending reductions impacted all our businesses and markets. Globally, the most impacted  businesses were our Experiential discipline, especially in our event marketing businesses, and our Execution & Support discipline,  primarily in field marketing. Most markets began to improve in April 2021. Our Business We are a strategic holding company providing advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to many  of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB, TBWA, Omnicom  Media Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='9integrate their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including the Omnicom Health Group, the Omnicom  Precision Marketing Group, the Omnicom Commerce Group, the Omnicom Advertising Collective, the Omnicom Public  Relations Group, and the Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution & Support  businesses, which includes the Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our networks, practice areas and agencies provide a comprehensive range of  services in the following fundamental disciplines: Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting,  Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations and Healthcare. Advertising & Media includes creative services across  digital and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media and data analytics services. Precision  Marketing includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting and data and analytics. Commerce & Brand  Consulting services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research, retail marketing and ecommerce marketing.  Experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution & Support includes  field marketing, sales support, digital and physical merchandising, point-of-sale and product placement, as well as other specialized  marketing and custom communications services. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis management,  public affairs and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media  services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies  operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our  fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our  service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom  collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration  allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and  comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing  clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary  companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that currently serve or could serve our existing clients. As a leading global advertising, marketing and corporate communications company, we operate in all major markets and have  a large client base. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our largest client represented 2.7% of revenue, and our 100 largest  clients, which represent many of the world’s major marketers, represented approximately 53% of revenue. Our clients operate in  virtually every sector of the global economy, with no one industry representing more than 17% of our revenue in 2022. Although  our revenue is generally balanced between the United States and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base,  we are not immune to general economic downturns. Certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures, such as the FIFA World Cup and the  Olympics, and certain national events, such as the U.S. election process, may affect our revenue period-over-period in certain  businesses. Typically, these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period. Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. Adverse global or regional  economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on advertising, marketing and corporate  communications services, which would reduce the demand for our services. Revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters  and higher in the second and fourth quarters, reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that  usually occurs in the fourth quarter. Given our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key performance  indicators that we focus on are revenue growth and variability of operating expenses. We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the  components and mix of the growth, including growth by principal regional market, practice area and marketing discipline, the  impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes, growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, and growth from our largest  clients. Operating expenses are analyzed in the following categories: cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses, or  SG&A, and depreciation and amortization. Results of Operations Revenue in 2022 decreased slightly to $14,289.1 million compared to $14,289.4 million in 2021. Organic growth  increased revenue $1,346.3 million, or 9.4%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue $681.0 million, or 4.8%,  and acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, reduced revenue $665.6 million, or 4.7%. The reduction in acquisition  revenue, net of disposition revenue, reflects dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021  and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. The change in revenue across our principal regional  markets were: North America increased $146.3 million, Europe decreased $209.1 million, Asia-Pacific decreased $49.5 million  and Latin America increased $32.9 million. In North America, organic revenue increased across all our disciplines, especially in ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='10our Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines, and was substantially offset by a reduction in  acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, primarily due to the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline in the  second quarter of 2021. In Europe, organic revenue increased in substantially all countries and in all disciplines, especially our  Advertising & Media discipline, which was led by our media business, our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines,  and our Experiential discipline, as it continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The increase in organic revenue was  offset by the weakening of substantially all foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar, especially the British Pound and the Euro, as  well as the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. In Latin America, organic revenue increased in most  countries in the region, especially Brazil and Colombia. The increase in organic revenue was partially offset by negative performance  in Mexico and the weakening of most currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar. In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue increased  in most disciplines, especially our Advertising & Media discipline, which was led by our media business, and in most of our major  markets in the region, particularly Australia, India, Japan, Korea and Malaysia. The increase in organic revenue was offset by the  weakening of all currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar and negative performance in our Experiential discipline, primarily  caused by prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The changes in revenue in 2022, compared to 2021, in our fundamental  disciplines were: Advertising & Media decreased $534.6 million, Precision Marketing increased $223.1 million, Commerce and  Brand Consulting increased $47.7 million, Experiential increased $99.6 million, Execution & Support decreased $46.6 million,  Public Relations increased $154.1 million, and Healthcare increased $56.4 million. We measure cost of services in two distinct categories: salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs. As a service  business, salary and service costs make up the significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise  the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services. Salary and service costs include employee compensation  and benefits, freelance labor and third-party service costs, which include third-party supplier costs when we act as principal in  providing services to our clients and client-related travel costs. Occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the  delivery of our services, including office rent and other occupancy costs, equipment rent, technology costs, general office expenses  and other expenses. Adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign currencies from period to period impact our results of operations  and financial position when we translate our financial statements from local foreign currencies to the U.S. Dollar. However,  substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency mitigating the impact of changes in foreign  currency exchange rates on our operating margin percentage. Operating expenses in 2022 increased $114.3 million, or 0.9%, to $12,205.8 million year-over-year. Operating expenses for  2022 reflect charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine of $113.4 million. Operating expenses in 2021 were favorably  impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline. The  weakening of most foreign currencies, especially the British Pound and Euro, against the U.S. Dollar reduced operating expenses  for 2022 as compared to the prior year, which was in line with the percentage reduction from changes in foreign currencies on  revenue. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased $76.1 million, compared to 2021,  reflecting a decrease in third-party service costs of $303.0 million, partially offset by an increase in salary and related service costs  of $226.9 million. Third-party service costs decreased during the year primarily due to the disposition in the Advertising & Media  discipline in the second quarter of 2021 and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in  salary and related service costs primarily resulted from the increase in organic revenue and an increase in headcount, as well as an  increase in travel and related costs, reflecting the post-pandemic return to the office of our workforce in most markets. Occupancy  and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $20.4 million  year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in general office expenses and other costs resulting from the return of our workforce to  the office, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs. Operating profit decreased $114.6 million to $2,083.3 million,  operating margin decreased to 14.6% from 15.4%, and EBITA margin decreased to 15.1% from 15.9%. Operating profit,  operating margin and EBITA margin for 2022 were negatively impacted by the $113.4 million charges arising from the effects of  the war in Ukraine. Operating profit, operating margin and EBITA margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million  gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline. SG&A expenses primarily consist of third-party marketing costs, professional fees and compensation and benefits and  occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices, including group-wide finance and accounting, treasury, legal and  governance, human resource oversight and similar costs. SG&A expenses decreased slightly year-over-year. Net interest expense in 2022 decreased $71.2 million year-over-year to $137.9 million. Interest expense on debt decreased  $21.9 million to $191.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the benefit from the early redemption in  May 2021 of all the outstanding $1.25 billion of our 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022, or 2022 Notes, which was partially offset  by the issuance of $800 million of our 2.60% Senior Notes due 2031, or 2031 Notes, in May 2021, and the issuance of the  £325 million 2.25% Senior Notes due 2033, or Sterling Notes, in November 2021. Interest expense for 2021 includes a loss  of $26.6 million on the early redemption of the 2022 Notes. Interest income in 2022 increased $43.4 million to $70.7 million  year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on our cash balances and our short-term investments.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='11Our effective tax rate for 2022 increased year-over-year to 28.1% from 24.6%. The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was  predominantly the result of the non-deductibility of the $113.4 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2022, arising from  the effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as an additional increase in income tax expense of $4.8 million related to the disposition  of our businesses in Russia. These charges were partially offset by the tax benefit arising from our share-based compensation awards.  The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a nominal tax applied to the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media  discipline resulting from the excess of tax over book basis and a reduction in income tax expense of $32.8 million, primarily related  to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2022 decreased $91.3 million to $1,316.5 million from $1,407.8 million in 2021.  The year-over-year decrease is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. decreased  to $6.36 in 2022, compared to $6.53 in 2021, due to the factors described above, partially offset by the impact of the reduction  in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for  restricted stock awards, stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year. The impact of the after-tax  charges arising from the effect of the war in Ukraine reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2022 by $118.2 million and  diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.57. The combined effect of the after-tax gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline and the loss on the early  redemption of the 2022 Notes increased net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2021 by $31.0 million and increased diluted net  income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.14. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the  related discussion in this MD&A. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity  in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of  our financial statements. Readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and  the related notes, including Note 2, for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below. Estimates We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and are required to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We use a fair value approach in  testing our intangible assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, for impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates  and assumptions. Acquisitions and Goodwill We have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. The evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on  various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position and service offerings of the  target businesses, as well as our experience and judgment. Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon  the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach  or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and  specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, as is typical in most service businesses, a substantial portion of the  assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the know-how of the personnel, which is treated as part of goodwill  and is not required to be valued separately under U.S. GAAP . For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify  other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired  is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In valuing these identified  intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year and whenever events or  circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we have  the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of our reporting  units exceeds their respective fair value (Step 0) or proceeding directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. While there were no  trigger events that required us to perform a quantitative test, we performed the annual quantitative impairment test and compared the  fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. We identified our regional reporting units as  components of our operating segments, which are our six global agency networks. The regional reporting units of each agency network  are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical  requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that  for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='12purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the  aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, and in FASB ASC Topic 350. Consistent with our fundamental  business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same  clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and the employees share similar  skill sets. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and  occupancy and other costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers,  servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead expenses. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by  multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy. Goodwill Impairment Review - Estimates and Assumptions We use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach,  which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples for EBITDA (earnings before  interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions. In applying the income approach, we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows (“DCF”) for each reporting  unit that serves as the basis of our valuation. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin,  EBITDA, tax rates, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long-term cash  flow growth rates. All of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses, economic conditions  related to the industry we operate in, as well as conditions in the global economy. The assumptions that have the most significant  effect on our valuations derived using a DCF methodology are: (1) the expected long-term growth rate of our reporting units’ cash  flows and (2) the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) for each reporting unit. The assumptions used for the long-term growth rate and WACC in our evaluations as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 were: 2022 2021 Long-Term Growth Rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.5% 3.5% WACC  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.1% - 12.0% 9.8% - 10.4% Long-term growth rate represents our estimate of the long-term growth rate for our industry and the markets of the global  economy we operate in. For the past ten years, the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the Average  Nominal GDP , or NGDP , growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue  was approximately 3.6% and 3.8%, respectively. We considered this history when determining the long-term growth rates used in  our annual impairment test at June 30, 2022, and included in the 10-year history is the full year 2020 that reflected the negative  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our revenue. We believe marketing expenditures over the long term  have a high correlation to NGDP . Based on our past performance, we also believe that our growth rate can exceed NGDP growth  in the short-term, notwithstanding the current inflationary environment, in the markets we operate in, which are similar across our  reporting units. Accordingly, for our annual test as of June 30, 2022, we used an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.5%. When performing the annual impairment test as of June 30, 2022 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units,  we considered the current macroeconomic environment, as well as industry and market specific conditions at mid-year 2022 and  projections through the end of the year. The assumptions of economic conditions and our actual performance as of December 31,  2022 were in line with these estimates. The WACC is comprised of: (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our  industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of  equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market, (3) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return  on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units, and (4) a current after-tax  market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative  market value percentages of our equity and debt. Our six reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them. These differences drive  variations in fair value among our reporting units. In addition, these differences as well as differences in book value, including  goodwill, cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units. The reporting unit  goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the  formation of Omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill  being recorded. The remaining three agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that  were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result, they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt. Finally,  the allocation of goodwill when components are transferred between reporting units is based on relative fair value at the time of  transfer.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='13Goodwill Impairment Review - Conclusion Based on the results of our impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill at June 30, 2022 was not impaired, because the  fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective net book value. For our reporting units with negative book  value, we concluded that the fair value of their total assets was in excess of book value. The minimum decline in fair value that one of  our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 46%. Notwithstanding  our belief that the assumptions we used for WACC and long-term growth rate in our impairment testing were reasonable, we  performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units. The results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of  June 30, 2022 revealed that if the WACC increased by 1% and/or the long-term growth rate decreased by 1%, the fair value of each  of our reporting units would continue to be in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test. We will continue to perform our impairment test each year at the end of the second quarter unless events or circumstances  trigger the need for an interim impairment test. There were no events through December 31, 2022 that would change our  impairment assessment. The estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future  results of operations, but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors  affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but they are  subject to change from period to period. Actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our  discounted cash flow valuation, and it is possible that differences could be significant. A change in the estimates we use could result  in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and  could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result  in a non-cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additional  information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control and receives the benefit of the promised goods or services (the performance  obligation) in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services (the transaction  price). We measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement.  Revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution  of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines: Advertising & Media, Precision  Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting, Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations and Healthcare. Our client contracts  are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis. Revenue is recorded net of sales, use and value added taxes. Performance Obligations. In substantially all our disciplines, the performance obligation is to provide advisory and  consulting services at an agreed-upon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement. Our client contracts are comprised  of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following: an agreed fee or rate per hour for the  level of effort expended by our employees; commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties;  qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract; and reimbursement for third-party costs that we are  required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal. The transaction  price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price and is  recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. Clients typically receive and  consume the benefit of our services as they are performed. Substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for  services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice, typically 90 days, without penalty. Generally, our short-term contracts, which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete, are performed by a single agency and  consist of a single performance obligation. As a result, we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance  obligations because our services are highly interrelated, occur in close proximity, and the integration of the various components of a  marketing message is essential to overall service. In certain of our long-term client contracts, which have a term of up to one year, the  performance obligation is a stand-ready obligation, because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract.  In other long-term contracts, when our services are not a stand-ready obligation, we consider our services distinct performance  obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price, including  contracts for strategic media planning and buying services, which are considered to be multiple performance obligations, and we  allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the stand-alone selling price. In substantially all of  our creative services contracts, we have distinct performance obligations for our services, including certain creative services contracts  where we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform studio production efforts. Revenue Recognition Methods. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time, as the services are performed,  because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period, or we create an asset  with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='14the contract for convenience. For these client contracts, other than when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services,  revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance  obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis. For client contracts when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services  on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract, typically for periods up to one year, where the scope of these arrangements is  broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services, we recognize revenue using a time-based measure resulting in a  straight-line revenue recognition. From time to time, there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of  a contract and the changes could be significant. These changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional  requirements and the associated costs, as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed. To a lesser extent, for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases, we recognize revenue  over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer, including milestones  achieved. Where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of  purchased media from third parties, the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable  contract providing a right to payment. Accordingly, revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time, typically when the  media is run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor. Principal vs. Agent. In substantially all our businesses, we incur third-party costs on behalf of clients, including direct costs  and incidental, or out-of-pocket costs. Third-party direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising  or marketing communication services include, among others: purchased media, studio production services, specialized talent,  including artists and other freelance labor, event marketing supplies, materials and services, promotional items, market research and  third-party data and other related expenditures. Out-of-pocket costs include, among others: transportation, hotel, meals, shipping  and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services. Billings related to out-of-pocket costs are  included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client. However, the inclusion of billings related to third-party direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or  as an agent in the client arrangement. In most of our businesses, including advertising, which also includes studio production  efforts and media planning and buying services, public relations, healthcare advertising, precision marketing, commerce and brand  consulting businesses, we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform certain services. In these  cases, we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client. As a result, revenue is recorded net of these costs,  equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission. In certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for third-party services on behalf of our clients. In our  experiential business and most of our execution and support businesses, including field marketing and certain specialty  marketing businesses, we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the  client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services, or we are responsible for directing and integrating  third-party vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price. In such arrangements, we also  take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. In certain specialty media buying businesses, we act as principal when we  control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor. In these arrangements, we  assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. When we act as principal, we include billable amounts related to  third-party costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed, including out-of-pocket costs,  consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract. However, in media buying contracts  where we act as principal, we recognize revenue at a point in time, typically when the media is run, including when it is not  subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor. Variable Consideration. Some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions, which include  performance incentives, tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the United States. Variable  consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method  or the most likely outcome method. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and other  factors known at the time. Performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time. Variable consideration for our  media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will  be run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client. In addition, when we receive rebates or credits from vendors  for transactions entered into on behalf of clients, they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or  retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law. Amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and  amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned, typically when the media is run.

       " Document(page_content='16Revenue Revenue in 2022 decreased slightly to $14,289.1 million compared to $14,289.4 million in 2021. Organic growth  increased revenue $1,346.3 million, or 9.4%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue $681.0 million, or 4.8%,  and acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, reduced revenue $665.6 million, or 4.7%. The reduction in acquisition  revenue, net of disposition revenue, reflects dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021  and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. The change in revenue across our principal regional  markets were: North America increased $146.3 million, Europe decreased $209.1 million, Asia-Pacific decreased $49.5 million  and Latin America increased $32.9 million. In North America, organic revenue increased across all our disciplines, especially in  our Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines, and was substantially offset by a reduction in  acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, primarily due to the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline in the  second quarter of 2021. In Europe, organic revenue increased in substantially all countries and in all disciplines, especially our  Advertising & Media discipline, which was led by our media business, our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines,  and our Experiential discipline, as it continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The increase in organic revenue was  offset by the weakening of substantially all foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar, especially the British Pound and the Euro, as  well as the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. In Latin America, organic revenue increased in most  countries in the region, especially Brazil and Colombia. The increase in organic revenue was partially offset by negative performance  in Mexico and the weakening of most currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar. In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue increased  in most disciplines, especially our Advertising & Media discipline, which was led by our media business, and in most of our major  markets in the region, particularly Australia, India, Japan, Korea and Malaysia. The increase in organic revenue was offset by the  weakening of all currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar and negative performance in our Experiential discipline, primarily  caused by prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The changes in revenue in 2022, compared to 2021, in our fundamental  disciplines were: Advertising & Media decreased $534.6 million, Precision Marketing increased $223.1 million, Commerce and  Brand Consulting increased $47.7 million, Experiential increased $99.6 million, Execution & Support decreased $46.6 million,  Public Relations increased $154.1 million, and Healthcare increased $56.4 million.

The foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current  period constant currency revenue ($14,289.1 million less $14,970.1 million for the Total column). • Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating  the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes  the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the  comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth.  Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating  the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition  revenue amounts are netted in the table. • Organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact, and the acquisition revenue, net of  disposition revenue components from total revenue growth. • The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that  component ($14,289.4 million for the Total column).', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='17Changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar affect our results of operations and financial position.  For the most part, because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency,  the economic impact on operating margin is minimized. Assuming exchange rates at February 3, 2023 remain unchanged, we  expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce revenue in the first quarter by approximately 3.0% and to be  flat for the year.

Revenue in the U.K., representing 10.7% of revenue, increased $7.6 million. Revenue in Continental Europe,  which includes the Euro Zone and the other European countries, representing 17.4% of revenue, decreased $216.7 million. The  organic revenue growth in Europe of 10.1% reflects organic growth in all disciplines and substantially all countries. The organic  revenue growth was offset by the weakening of most currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar, especially the British Pound  and the Euro, and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. In the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors.  Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. In 2022 and 2021, our largest  client represented 2.7% and 3.2% of revenue, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 19.1% and 53.1% of  revenue for 2022, respectively, and 21.7% and 53.6% of revenue for 2021, respectively. To monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor  revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories: Advertising & Media, Precision  Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting, Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations and Healthcare.

Operating expenses for  2022 reflect charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine of $113.4 million. Operating expenses in 2021 were favorably  impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline. The  weakening of most foreign currencies, especially the British Pound and Euro, against the U.S. Dollar reduced operating expenses  for 2022 as compared to the prior year, which was in line with the percentage reduction from changes in foreign currencies on  revenue. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased $76.1 million, compared to 2021,  reflecting a decrease in third-party service costs of $303.0 million, partially offset by an increase in salary and related service costs  of $226.9 million. Third-party service costs decreased during the year primarily due to the disposition in the Advertising & Media  discipline in the second quarter of 2021 and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in  salary and related service costs primarily resulted from the increase in organic revenue and an increase in headcount, as well as an  increase in travel and related costs, reflecting the post-pandemic return to the office of our workforce in most markets. Occupancy  and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $20.4 million ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='19year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in general office expenses and other costs resulting from the post-pandemic return of  our workforce to the office, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs. Operating profit decreased $114.6 million  to $2,083.3 million, operating margin decreased to 14.6% from 15.4%, and EBITA margin decreased to 15.1% from 15.9%.  Operating profit, operating margin and EBITA margin for 2022 were negatively impacted by the $113.4 million charges arising  from the effects of the war in Ukraine. Operating profit, operating margin and EBITA margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by  the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with the dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense in 2022 decreased $71.2 million year-over-year to $137.9 million. Interest expense on debt decreased  $21.9 million to $191.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the benefit from the early redemption in  May 2021 of all the outstanding 2022 Notes, which was partially offset by the issuance of the 2031 Notes in May 2021, and  the issuance of the Sterling Notes in November 2021. Interest expense for 2021 includes a loss of $26.6 million on the early  redemption of the 2022 Notes. Interest income in 2022 increased $43.4 million to $70.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a  result of higher interest rates on our cash balances and our short-term investments. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2022 increased year-over-year to 28.1% from 24.6%. The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was  predominantly the result of the non-deductibility of the $113.4 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2022, arising from  the effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as an additional increase in income tax expense of $4.8 million related to the disposition  of our businesses in Russia. These charges were partially offset by the tax benefit arising from our share-based compensation awards.  The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a nominal tax applied to the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media  discipline resulting from the excess of tax over book basis and a reduction in income tax expense of $32.8 million, primarily related  to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. For 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to increase  to approximately 27%, primarily due to the increase in the UK tax rate from 19% to 25% in April 2023. Net Income and Net Income Per Share - Omnicom Group Inc. Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2022 decreased $91.3 million to $1,316.5 million from $1,407.8 million in 2021.  The year-over-year decrease is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. decreased  to $6.36 in 2022, compared to $6.53 in 2021, due to the factors described above, partially offset by the impact of the reduction  in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for  restricted stock awards, stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year. The impact of the after-tax  charges arising from the effect of the war in Ukraine reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2022 by $118.2 million and  diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.57.

We define  EBITA as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangible assets, and EBITA Margin as EBITA divided by revenue.  EBITA and EBITA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures for  investors to evaluate the performance of our business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or  as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP . Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

       " Document(page_content='21Revenue Revenue in 2021 increased $1,118.3 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2020. Organic growth increased revenue 10.2%, and  changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue 2.2%. Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, reduced revenue 3.9%,  reflecting the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021. In 2021, our business experienced  a recovery from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in all our disciplines and regional markets as compared to 2020.  The negative effects from the pandemic did not significantly impact our major markets and businesses until late in the first quarter  of 2020. As a result, the improvement in revenue in 2021 versus the prior year was driven by the recovery in the second, third and  fourth quarters of 2021 as compared to the prior year. The change in revenue across our principal regional markets were: North  America increased $132.6 million, Europe increased $611.9 million, Asia-Pacific increased $292.7 million and Latin America  increased $20.7 million. In North America, improved organic revenue growth in the United States and Canada was partially offset  by a decrease in revenue resulting from the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021. The  United States experienced organic revenue growth in all disciplines, led by our Advertising discipline, on the strength of our media  business, and our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines. In Europe, organic revenue increased in substantially all  countries and disciplines, especially our Advertising discipline, which was led by our media business, and our Experiential, Precision  Marketing and Commerce and Brand Consulting disciplines. The strengthening of the British Pound and the Euro against the  U.S. Dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region. In Latin America, organic revenue growth in all countries in the region,  especially Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, primarily in our Advertising discipline, was partially offset by the weakening of the Brazilian  Real against the U.S. Dollar. In Asia-Pacific, revenue increased due to strong organic revenue growth in substantially all countries,  particularly China, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Japan and in all disciplines. The strengthening of substantially all currencies  against the U.S. Dollar contributed to increased revenue in the region. The increases in revenue in 2021, compared to 2020, in our  fundamental disciplines were: Advertising & Marketing $447.9 million, Precision Marketing $250.2 million, Commerce & Brand  Consulting $88.9 million, Experiential $119.1 million, Execution & Support $65.3 million, Public Relations $80.8 million and  Healthcare $66.1 million.

The foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current  period constant currency revenue ($14,289.4 million less $14,001.2 million for the Total column). • Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating  the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes  the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the  comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth.  Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating  the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition  revenue amounts are netted in the table. • Organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact, and the acquisition revenue, net of  disposition revenue components from total revenue growth. • The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that  component ($13,171.1 million for the Total column).', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='22Changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar affect our results of operations and financial position.

Revenue in the U.K., representing 10.6% of total revenue, increased $237.7 million. Revenue in  Continental Europe, which comprises the Euro Zone and the other European countries, representing 18.9% of total revenue,  increased $374.2 million. The increase in revenue is due to strong organic growth in all countries and disciplines, as well as the  strengthening of the British Pound and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. In the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors.  Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. In 2021 and 2020, our largest  client represented 3.2% and 3.4% of revenue, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 21.7% and 53.6% of  revenue in 2021, respectively, and 20.8% and 54.0% of revenue in 2020, respectively. All our business experienced the effects from client spending reductions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spending  reductions impacted all our disciplines and markets. The most significantly impacted were our advertising discipline, our  Experiential discipline, especially in our event marketing businesses, and our Execution & Support discipline, primarily in our field  marketing and merchandising businesses. Our Public Relations discipline was less significantly impacted, and our Healthcare and  Precision Marketing disciplines performed well.

The  increases in operating profit, operating margin and EBITA margin reflect the positive impact of organic revenue growth, the  positive impact of cost reduction actions taken in the prior year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative impact  in the prior year from the net increase in operating expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2020 aggregating $171.1 million,  related to the COVID-19 repositioning costs, and asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset  by the benefit of $162.6 million related to reimbursements under pandemic relief government programs. Additionally, operating  profit, operating margin and EBITA margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection  with the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline. Net Interest Expense In 2021, net interest expense increased $19.6 million year-over-year to $209.1 million. Interest expense on debt in  2021 increased $13.6 million to $213.2 million compared to 2020, primarily arising from a loss of $26.6 million on the early  redemption in May 2021 of all the outstanding $1.25 billion of the 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022, or 2022 Notes, which was  partially offset by the benefit from the issuance of $800 million of the 2.60% Senior Notes due 2031, or 2031 Notes, at a lower  rate. Interest income in 2021 decreased $5.0 million year-over-year to $27.3 million primarily due to lower rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2021 decreased year-over-year to 24.6% from 27.1%. In connection with the disposition in the  Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021, we recorded a pretax gain of $50.5 million. The lower effective tax  rate for 2021 was predominantly the result of $32.8 million favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain domestic  jurisdictions, as well as a nominal tax applied against the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline  resulting from excess tax over book basis. The effective tax rate for 2020 reflects an increase due to the non-deductibility in certain  jurisdictions of a portion of the COVID-19 repositioning charges recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Net Income and Net Income Per Share - Omnicom Group Inc. Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2021 increased $462.4 million to $1,407.8 million from $945.4 million in 2020.  The year-over-year increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased  to $6.53 in 2021, compared to $4.37 in 2020, due to the factors described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our  weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the resumption of repurchases of our common stock during the year,  net of shares issued for restricted stock awards, stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year. The combined effect of the after-tax gain from the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline and the loss on the early  redemption of the 2022 Notes increased net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2021 by $31.0 million. In 2020, the net after-tax  effect on net income - Omnicom Group Inc. from the COVID-19 repositioning costs and asset impairment charges was a decrease  of $270.2 million, which was partially offset by a net after-tax increase in net income - Omnicom Group Inc. from reimbursements  under government programs of $123.4 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Sources and Requirements Primary sources of our short-term liquidity are operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  Additional liquidity sources include our $2.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a termination  date of February 14, 2025, the ability to issue up to $2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated commercial paper and issue up to the  equivalent of $500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program, and access to the capital markets.  Certain of our international subsidiaries have uncommitted credit lines aggregating $582.9 million, which are guaranteed by  Omnicom. Our liquidity sources fund our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. Working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, is our principal non-discretionary funding  requirement. Our working capital cycle typically peaks during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for  incentive compensation, income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations. In addition, we have contractual obligations  related to our long-term debt (principal and interest payments), recurring business operations, primarily related to lease  obligations, and acquisition related obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common  shareholders, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

The decrease was principally due to the  decrease in cash from operating capital of $844.0 million, primarily as a result of disposition activity in 2021 and 2022 in the  Advertising & Media discipline, and the timing and volume of client billings year-over-year, which negatively impacted our  operating capital funding. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow from operations had no material impact on our liquidity, and  there were no issuances of commercial paper or borrowing under the Credit Facility during the year. Principal cash sources and principal cash uses are Non-GAAP liquidity measures. These amounts exclude changes in operating  capital and other investing and financing activities. This presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and  uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to  understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents. Non-GAAP liquidity  measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with  U.S. GAAP . Non-GAAP liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other  companies. Additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated statement of cash flows and Note 14  to the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2022, we have the following contractual obligations: • We have outstanding fixed-rate debt maturing at various times with an aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion, of  which $750 million is due in 2024. Depending on the conditions in the credit markets, we may refinance this debt, or  we may use cash from operations, including temporally accessing our Credit Facility, to repay this debt. Future interest  payments on our debt total $868.5 million, of which $159.1 million is payable in 2023. • The liability for our operating and finance lease payments is $1,527.8 million, of which $297.0 million is due in 2023. • The obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is $228.6 million, and the liability for our postemployment  arrangements is $130.8 million. In 2022, we contributed $8.2 million to our defined benefit plans and paid $10.4 million  for our postemployment arrangements. We do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2023. • The liability for contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs) is $115.0 million, of which $39.2 million is payable in  2023. • The remaining balance for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings imposed by the Tax Cut and Jobs  Act of 2017 is $88.8 million, of which $19.9 million is expected to be paid in 2023. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments  and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our non-discretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months. Over the  longer term, our Credit Facility is available to fund our working capital and contractual obligations.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='26Cash Management Our regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia manage our cash and liquidity. Each day, operations with  excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funds borrow from their  regional treasury center. T reasury centers with excess cash invest on a short-term basis with third parties, generally with maturities  ranging from overnight to less than 90 days. Beginning in 2022, we purchased short-term investments with maturities ranging  from 91 to 364 days. The balance of our short-term investments at December 31, 2022 was $60.7 million. Certain treasury centers  have notional pooling arrangements that are used to manage their cash and set-off foreign exchange imbalances. The arrangements require each treasury center to have its own notional pool account and to maintain a notional positive  account balance. Additionally, under the terms of the arrangement, set-off of foreign exchange positions are limited to the long  and short positions within their own account. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they have the ability to  issue up to a total of $2.0 billion of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper and issue up to the equivalent of $500 million in  British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program, or borrow under the Credit Facility or the uncommitted credit  lines. This process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively, as well as manage our risk  to foreign exchange rate imbalances. In countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one  of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis, we arrange for local currency uncommitted  credit lines. We have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents  and we have deposit limits for each institution. In countries where we conduct treasury operations, generally the counterparties are  either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the Credit Facility. These institutions generally have credit ratings  equal to or better than our credit ratings. In countries where we do not conduct treasury operations, all cash and cash equivalents  are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards. At December 31, 2022, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.1 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of  $4.3 billion. Substantially all of the cash is available to us, net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the  United States. At December 31, 2022, our net debt position, which we define as total debt, including short-term debt, less cash and cash  equivalents and short-term investments increased $873.1 million to $1.3 billion from December 31, 2021. The increase in net debt  primarily resulted from discretionary spending of $1.7 billion and the net effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash  equivalents and our foreign currency denominated debt of $103.4 million, partially offset by cash flow from operating activities of  $926.5 million.

OFH’s assets consist of its investments  in several wholly owned finance companies that function as treasury centers, providing funding for various operating companies in  Europe, Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The finance companies’ assets consist of cash and cash equivalents  and intercompany loans that they make or have made to the operating companies in their respective regions and the related interest  receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of Omnicom, OCI or OFH to obtain funds from their subsidiaries through  dividends, loans or advances.

Omnicom has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Omnicom Capital Holdings plc, or OCH, a  U.K.-based wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, with respect to the £325 million 2.25% Senior Notes due 2033, or the Sterling  Notes. OCH’s assets consist of its investments in several wholly owned finance companies that function as treasury centers,  providing funding for various operating companies in EMEA, Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The finance  companies’ assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans that they make or have made to the operating  companies in their respective regions and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of Omnicom or  OCH to obtain funds from their subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. The Sterling Notes and the related guarantee  are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of  OCH and Omnicom, respectively. The Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of consolidated indebtedness to  consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash charges) of no more than 3.5 times  for the most recently ended 12-month period. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with this covenant as our Leverage  Ratio was 2.4 times. The Credit Facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may use LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate. The LIBOR benchmark rate is expected  to be phased out by the end of June 2023. We do not expect that the discontinuation of the LIBOR rate will have a material impact  on our liquidity or results of operations. At December 31, 2022, our long-term and short-term debt was rated BBB+ and A2 by S&P and Baa1 and P2 by Moody’s.  Our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by market conditions and our credit  ratings. The long-term debt indentures and the Credit Facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments  in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings. Credit Markets and Availability of Credit In light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions, we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to  changing economic conditions, and we will continue to manage our discretionary expenditures. We will continue to monitor and  manage the level of credit made available to our clients. We believe that these actions, in addition to the availability of our Credit  Facility, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital needs and our discretionary spending. Information regarding our  Credit Facility is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. We have the ability to fund our day-to-day liquidity, including working capital, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing  under the Credit Facility. During 2022 and 2021, there were no issuances of commercial paper or borrowings under the Credit  Facility. We can resume issuing commercial paper to fund our day-to-day liquidity when needed. However, disruptions in the credit  markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads. To mitigate any disruption in  the credit markets and to fund our liquidity, we may borrow under the Credit Facility or the uncommitted credit lines or access the  capital markets if favorable conditions exist. We will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets.  We cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any disruptions in the credit markets. In such circumstances, we may  need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. Such additional financing may not be  available on favorable terms, or at all. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of  derivative financial instruments. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility  arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We use net investment hedges to manage the volatility of foreign exchange rates  on the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Using derivatives ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='28exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. We manage that  risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit  standards and other factors. We evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our  derivatives. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a value-at-risk, or  VaR, analysis. VaR is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange rate data to measure the potential impact on future  earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. The VaR model is not intended to represent  actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95%  confidence a maximum one-day change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2022 was not  significant. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In 2022, our international operations represented approximately 48% of our revenue. Changes in the value of foreign  currencies against the U.S. Dollar affect our results of operations and financial position. For the most part, because the revenue  and expenses of our foreign operations are denominated in the same local currency, the economic impact on operating margin  is minimized. The effects of foreign currency exchange transactions on our results of operations are discussed in Note 2 to the  consolidated financial statements. We operate in all major international markets including the Euro Zone, the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China and  Japan. Our agencies transact business in more than 50 different currencies. As an integral part of our global treasury operations, we  centralize our cash and use notional multicurrency pools to manage the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances  between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers. In addition, there are circumstances where revenue and expense  transactions are not denominated in the same currency. In these instances, amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with  forward foreign exchange contracts. To manage this risk, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding forward foreign  exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $40.3 million and $77.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and  2021, the net fair value of the forward foreign contracts was not material (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). Foreign currency derivatives are designated as economic hedges; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those  instruments is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying exposure. By using these financial  instruments, we reduce financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain which might occur if the markets  move favorably. The terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than 90 days. In 2022, we entered into fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps with a notional value of $150 million to hedge a portion of the  net investment in our Japanese subsidiaries against volatility in the Yen/U.S. Dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and  qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2025 and 2029. Changes in the fair  value of the swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  (loss), or AOCI. Any gain or loss will remain in AOCI until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment  in the underlying operations. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot  exchange rates. We receive net fixed U.S. Dollar interest payments, and in 2022, we recorded $1.2 million as a reduction of interest  expense. At December 31, 2022, the liability for the swap fair value was $16.5 million and is recorded in long-term liabilities. Interest Rate Risk We may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix  of fixed rate and floating rate debt. During 2022, there were no interest rate swaps, and long-term debt at December 31, 2022  consisted entirely of fixed rate debt. Credit Risk We provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand clients that operate in nearly  every sector of the global economy and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. Due to the diversified  nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client represented  2.7% of revenue in 2022. However, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production  companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are  included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by  local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a  disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='29certain foreign markets, many of our agencies’ contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not  liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by  our client for the media or production services. Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of  sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly and such a loss  could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, our methods of managing the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in  advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, may be insufficient, less available, or  unavailable during a severe economic downturn.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports  we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within applicable time periods. Disclosure controls and  procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by  us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is accumulated  and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, as  appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our CEO and CFO, conducted an  evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our  CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that  decisions can be made timely with respect to required disclosures, as well as ensuring that the recording, processing, summarization  and reporting of information required to be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022  are appropriate. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as  such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management, with the participation of our CEO, CFO and our agencies,  conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal  Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission.  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of  December 31, 2022. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal  quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on Omnicom’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2022, dated February 8, 2023, which is included on page F-2 of this 2022 Form 10-K.

       " Document(page_content='F-1MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information of Omnicom  Group Inc., or Omnicom. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the consolidated financial statements present fairly,  in all material respects, Omnicom’s consolidated financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted  accounting principles in the United States. The financial statements have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the  standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Their report expresses the independent accountant’s judgment as  to the fairness of management’s reported financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This judgment is based on the  procedures described in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of their report. Omnicom management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,  as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive  Officer, or CEO, Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, and our agencies, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal  control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our  internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. There have not been any changes in our internal  control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our  internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on Omnicom’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2022, dated February 8, 2023. The Board of Directors of Omnicom has an Audit Committee comprised of four independent directors. The Audit  Committee meets periodically with financial management, Internal Audit and the independent auditors to review accounting,  control, audit and financial reporting matters.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='F-2REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors  Omnicom Group Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Omnicom Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as  of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows  for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II  (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as  of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of  the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal  control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included  in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial  reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal  securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,  whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material  respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material  misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond  to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the  consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates  made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal  control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the  risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions  of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the  company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='F-3Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial  statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or  disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or  complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate  opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue recognition As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides an extensive range of advertising,  marketing and corporate communication services through its networks, practice areas and agencies, which operate in all major  markets throughout the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Consolidated revenues across all disciplines and geographic  markets was $14,289.1 million for the year-ended December 31, 2022. We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. Revenue is  recognized from contracts with customers that are based on statements of work which are typically separately negotiated with  the client at a local agency level and local agencies execute tens of thousands of contracts per year. Evaluating the sufficiency  of audit evidence obtained required a high degree of auditor judgment because of the volume of contracts entered into across  the networks and agencies for which revenue was recorded. This included selecting the locations where testing would be  performed and the supervision and review of procedures performed at those locations. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment  to determine the scope of agencies at which we performed audit procedures and the nature and extent of the procedures  performed at each location. At each agency where procedures over revenue were performed, we (1) evaluated the design and  tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over revenue recognition, including controls to check that local  agencies recorded revenue in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies and billings were recorded and presented in  accordance with client agreements, (2) examined a selection of contracts and assessed that the Company’s accounting policies  were applied consistently and accurately, and (3) assessed the recording of revenue by selecting certain transactions and  comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with the underlying documentation including contracts with customers.  We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed over revenue  recognition. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

       " Document(page_content='F-9OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Presentation of Financial Statements The terms “Omnicom,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Omnicom Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless  the context indicates otherwise. The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP or GAAP . All intercompany balances and transactions have been  eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from  those estimates and assumptions. Risks and Uncertainties Current global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the lingering effects of the COVID-19  pandemic, high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions could cause economic uncertainty  and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic  conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to  align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to  the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client  revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments. Impact of the War in Ukraine Historically, we conducted operations in Russia and Ukraine through local agencies in which we held a majority stake. During  the first quarter of 2022, the war in Ukraine required us to suspend our business operations in Ukraine. The war resulted in the  imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affected the cross-border operations  of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, Russian regulators imposed currency restrictions and regulations. All of these actions  created uncertainty regarding our ability to recover our investment in our operations in Russia, as well as our ability to exercise  control over the operations. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia was uncertain. As a result, we disposed of all of our  businesses in Russia. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pretax charges of $113.4 million, which primarily consisted  of the net investment in our Russian businesses, and included charges related to the suspension of operations in Ukraine. Lingering Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected global economic activity. Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through  the first quarter of 2021, our business was impacted by reductions in client spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While  mixed by business and geography, the spending reductions impacted all our businesses and markets. Globally, the most impacted  businesses were our Experiential discipline, especially in our event marketing businesses, and our Execution & Support discipline,  primarily in field marketing. Most markets began to improve in April 2021. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control and receives the benefit of the promised goods or  services (the performance obligation) in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods  or services (the transaction price). We measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified  in the client arrangement. Revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Our revenue is primarily derived  from the planning and execution of advertising communications and marketing services in the following fundamental disciplines:  Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing, Commerce & Brand Consulting, Experiential, Execution & Support, Public Relations  and Healthcare. Our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis. Revenue is recorded net of  sales, use and value added taxes. Performance Obligations. In substantially all our disciplines, the performance obligation is to provide advisory and  consulting services at an agreed-upon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement. Our client contracts are comprised  of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following: an agreed fee or rate per hour for the  level of effort expended by our employees; commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties;  qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract; and reimbursement for third-party costs that we are  required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to these costs and we act as principal. The transaction  price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price and is  recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. Clients typically receive and  consume the benefit of our services as they are performed. Substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for  services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice, typically 90 days, without penalty.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-10Generally, our short-term contracts, which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete, are performed by a single agency  and consist of a single performance obligation. As a result, we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct  performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated, occur in close proximity, and the integration of the various  components of a marketing message is essential to overall service. In certain of our long-term client contracts, which have a term of  up to one year, the performance obligation is a stand-ready obligation, because we provide a constant level of similar services over  the term of the contract. In other long-term contracts, when our services are not a stand-ready obligation, we consider our services  distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its stand-alone  selling price, including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services, which are considered to be multiple performance  obligations, and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the stand-alone selling  price. In substantially all of our creative services contracts, we have distinct performance obligations for our services, including  certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform studio  production efforts. Revenue Recognition Methods. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time, as the services are performed,  because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period, or we create an asset  with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates  the contract for convenience. For these client contracts, other than when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services,  revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance  obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis. For client contracts when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services  on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract, typically for periods up to one year, where the scope of these arrangements is  broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services, we recognize revenue using a time-based measure resulting in a  straight-line revenue recognition. From time to time, there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of  a contract and the changes could be significant. These changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional  requirements and the associated costs, as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed. To a lesser extent, for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases, we recognize revenue  over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer, including milestones  achieved. Where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of  purchased media from third parties, the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable  contract providing a right to payment. Accordingly, revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time, typically when the  media is run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor. Principal vs. Agent. In substantially all our businesses, we incur third-party costs on behalf of clients, including direct costs  and incidental, or out-of-pocket costs. Third-party direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising  or marketing communication services include, among others: purchased media, studio production services, specialized talent,  including artists and other freelance labor, event marketing supplies, materials and services, promotional items, market research and  third-party data and other related expenditures. Out-of-pocket costs include, among others: transportation, hotel, meals, shipping  and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services. Billings related to out-of-pocket costs are  included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client. However, the inclusion of billings related to third-party direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or  as an agent in the client arrangement. In most of our businesses, including advertising, which also includes studio production  efforts and media planning and buying services, public relations, healthcare advertising, precision marketing, commerce and brand  consulting businesses, we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform certain services. In these  cases, we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client. As a result, revenue is recorded net of these costs,  equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission. In certain businesses we may act as principal when contracting for third-party services on behalf of our clients. In our  experiential business and most of our execution and support businesses, including field marketing and certain specialty  marketing businesses, we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the  client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services, or we are responsible for directing and integrating  third-party vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price. In such arrangements, we also  take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. In certain specialty media buying businesses, we act as principal when we  control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor. In these arrangements, we ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-11assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. When we act as principal, we include billable amounts related to  third-party costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed, including out-of-pocket costs,  consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract. However, in media buying contracts  where we act as principal, we recognize revenue at a point in time, typically when the media is run, including when it is not  subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor. Variable Consideration. Some of our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions, which include  performance incentives, tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the United States. Variable  consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method  or the most likely outcome method. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and other  factors known at the time. Performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time. Variable consideration for our  media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will  be run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client. In addition, when we receive rebates or credits from vendors  for transactions entered into on behalf of clients, they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or  retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law. Amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and  amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned, typically when the media is run. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, and  depreciation and amortization. We measure cost of services in two distinct categories: salary and service costs and occupancy and  other costs. As a service business, salary and service costs make up the vast majority of our operating expenses and substantially  all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services. Salary and service costs include  employee compensation and benefits, freelance labor and service costs, which primarily include third-party supplier costs and  out-of-pocket costs. Occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services, including office  rent and other occupancy costs, equipment rent, technology costs, general office and other expenses. SG&A expenses primarily  consist of third-party marketing costs, professional fees and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our  corporate and executive offices, which includes group-wide finance and accounting, treasury, legal and governance, human resource  oversight and similar costs. Receipt of reimbursements under government programs for certain operating expenses are recorded as a  reduction to the related operating expense. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and highly liquid interest-bearing time deposits with  original maturities of three months or less. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, carrying value approximates fair  value. We have a policy governing counterparty credit risk for financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and we  have deposit limits for each institution. Short-T erm Investments. Short-term investments represent time deposits with original maturities ranging from 91 to 364 days.  These investments are classified as held-to-maturity securities because we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity.  Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Fair value is based on observable interest  rates for similar securities. Work in Process. Work in process represents accrued costs incurred on behalf of customers, including media and production costs,  and fees and other third-party costs that have not yet been billed. Media and production costs are billed during the production  process in accordance with the terms of the client contract. Substantially all unbilled fees and costs will be billed within the next  30 days. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the  assets using the straight-line method ranging from: three to five years for equipment, seven to ten years for furniture, and up  to 40 years for office buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or  the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets under finance leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Equity Method Investments. Investments in companies where we exercise significant influence over the operating and financial  policies of the investee and own less than 50% of the equity are accounted for using the equity method. Our proportionate share  of the net income or loss of equity method investments is included in results of operations and any dividends received reduce the  carrying value of the investment. The excess of the cost of our investment over our proportionate share of the fair value of the  net assets of the investee at the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill and included in the carrying amount of the investment.  Goodwill in the equity method investments is not amortized. Gains and losses from changes in our ownership interests are ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-12recorded in results of operations until control is achieved. In circumstances where a change in our ownership interest results in  obtaining control, the existing carrying value of the investment is remeasured to the acquisition date fair value and any gain or loss  is recognized in results of operations. We periodically review the carrying value of the equity method investments to determine if  there has been an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value. A variety of factors are considered when determining if a decline  in carrying value is other-than-temporary, including the financial condition and business prospects of the investee, as well as our  investment intent. Marketable Equity Securities. Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in  results of operations. Non-Marketable Equity Securities. Non-marketable equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and are  measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for observable changes in fair value from transactions for identical or  similar securities of the same issuer. Business Combinations. In a business combination, the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are recorded at acquisition date fair value. In circumstances where control  is obtained and less than 100% of a business is acquired, goodwill is recorded as if 100% were acquired. Acquisition-related costs,  including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs are expensed as incurred. Certain acquisitions include an initial  payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs), which are recorded as a  liability at the acquisition date fair value using the discount rate in effect on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair  value of the liability are recorded in results of operations. Amounts earned under the contingent purchase price arrangements may  be subject to a maximum and payment is not contingent upon future employment. The results of operations of acquired businesses  are included in results of operations from the acquisition date. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically reviewed for impairment. Intangible assets comprise customer relationships, including  the related customer contracts and trade names, and purchased and internally developed software and are amortized over their  estimated useful lives ranging from five to twelve years. We consider a number of factors in determining the useful lives and  amortization method, including the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, as well as trade name recognition and  customer attrition. There is no estimated residual value for the intangible assets. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events  or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation compares the fair value of each  reporting unit, which we identified as our six agency networks, to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the  reporting unit is equal to or greater than its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying value  of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is written down to its fair value through a non-cash expense recorded in results  of operations in the period the impairment is identified. We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our six agency networks.  The regional reporting units and practice areas of each agency network monitor the performance and are responsible for the  agencies in their region. The regional reporting units report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and  logistical requirements of our client-centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that,  for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated  for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis  of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, and the guidance set forth in FASB ASC  Topic 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional  reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. The main economic components of  each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs, which include  rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software and  other overhead costs. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as  they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy. We use the following valuation methodologies  to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach, which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows,  (2) comparative market participant multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and  (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-13Based on the results of the annual impairment test, we concluded that at June 30, 2022 and 2021 goodwill was not impaired  because either the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its respective net book value, or for reporting units  with a negative book value, fair value of assets exceeds total assets. Subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test, there have  been no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim impairment test. Debt Issuance Costs. Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized in interest expense over the life of the related debt and are  presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of debt. T emporary Equity – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Owners of noncontrolling equity interests in some of our subsidiaries  have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase all or a portion of their equity interests at fair value as defined in  the applicable agreements. The intent of the parties is to approximate fair value at the time of redemption by using a multiple of  earnings that is consistent with generally accepted valuation practices used by market participants in our industry. These contingent  redemption rights are embedded in the equity security at issuance, are not free-standing instruments, do not represent a de facto  financing and are not under our control. Treasury Stock. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for at cost and are recorded as treasury stock. Reissued treasury  stock, primarily in connection with share-based compensation plans, is accounted for at average cost. Gains or losses on reissued  treasury stock arising from the difference between the average cost and the fair value of the award are recorded in additional paid-in  capital and do not affect results of operations. Noncontrolling Interests. Noncontrolling interests represent equity interests in certain subsidiaries held by third parties.  Noncontrolling interests are presented as a component of equity and the proportionate share of net income attributed to the  noncontrolling interests is recorded in results of operations. Changes in noncontrolling interests that do not result in a loss of  control are accounted for in equity. Gains and losses resulting from a loss of control are recorded in results of operations. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions. Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their  functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated from the local functional currency into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate on  the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. T ranslation adjustments  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions not in  the subsidiaries local currency are recorded in results of operations. In 2022, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of  $1.1 million, and recorded foreign currency transactions losses of $3.3 million and $4.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Foreign currency gains and losses for hyper-inflationary economies are recorded in results of operations. Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation for restricted stock and stock option awards is measured at the grant date  fair value. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined and fixed using the closing price of our common stock on the  grant date and is recorded in additional paid-in capital. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes  option valuation model. For awards with a service only vesting condition, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the requisite service period. For awards with a performance vesting condition, compensation expense is recognized on  a graded-vesting basis. Typically, all share-based awards are settled with treasury stock. See Note 10 for additional information  regarding our specific award plans. Salary Continuation Agreements. Arrangements with certain present and former employees provide for continuing payments for  periods up to ten years after cessation of full-time employment in consideration for agreement by the employees not to compete  with us and to render consulting services during the postemployment period. Such payments, which are subject to certain  limitations, including our operating performance during the postemployment period, represent the fair value of the services  rendered and are expensed in such periods. Severance. The liability for one-time termination benefits, such as severance pay or benefit payouts, is measured and recognized  at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. Subsequent changes to the liability are recognized in results of operations in the  period of change. Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Postemployment Arrangements. The funded status of our defined benefit plans is recorded as  an asset or liability. Funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at December 31,  the measurement date, determined on a plan-by-plan basis. The benefit obligation for the defined benefit plans is the projected  benefit obligation, or PBO, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on  estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value. Overfunded plans, where  the fair value of plan assets exceeds the benefit obligation, are aggregated and recorded as a prepaid pension asset equal to the excess. ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-14Underfunded plans, where the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, are aggregated and recorded as a liability  equal to the excess. The benefit obligation liability for our postemployment arrangements is the PBO and these arrangements are  not funded. The current portion of the benefit obligation for the defined benefit plans and postemployment arrangements, which  represents the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months that exceed the fair value of plan assets, is  recorded in other current liabilities and the long-term portion is recorded in long-term liabilities. Deferred Compensation. Some of our subsidiaries have deferred compensation arrangements with certain executives that provide  for payments over varying terms upon retirement, cessation of employment or death. The cost of these arrangements is accrued  during the employee’s service period. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is  recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current period and the deferred taxes recognized during the period. Deferred  income taxes reflect the temporary difference between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes  and income tax purposes and are recorded as noncurrent. Deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates that are  assumed to be in effect when the differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded where it is more likely than not that all or a  portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate factors such as prior  earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance  the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. Interest and penalties related to tax positions taken in our tax returns are recorded in income tax expense. We record a  liability for uncertain tax positions that reflects the treatment of certain tax positions taken in our tax returns that do not meet the  more-likely-than not threshold. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations concerning  such issues lapses, we do not generally recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions. Net Income Per Share. Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during  the period. Diluted net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the dilutive  effect of common share equivalents, which include outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards. Leases. At the inception of a contract we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A lease is classified as a finance lease if  any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains  an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful  life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is  classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of the criteria. Substantially all our operating leases are leases for office  space, and substantially all our finance leases are leases for office furniture and technology equipment. For all leases a right-of-use, or ROU, asset and lease liability are recognized at the lease commencement date. The lease  liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which  includes the initial lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, consisting mainly of brokerage commissions, less any lease  incentives received. All ROU assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the  lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured  incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease. For real estate and certain equipment operating leases, we  use our secured incremental borrowing rate. For finance leases, we use the rate implicit in the lease or our secured incremental  borrowing rate if the implicit lease rate cannot be determined. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments  for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination  options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early. Lease components, including fixed payments for real  estate taxes and insurance for office space leases, are included in the measurement of the initial lease liability. Office space leases may contain variable lease payments, which include payments based on an index or rate. Variable lease  payments based on an index or rate are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Additional  payments based on the change in an index or rate, or payments based on a change in our portion of the operating expenses,  including real estate taxes and insurance, are recorded as a period expense when incurred. Lease modifications result in  remeasurement of the lease liability.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-15Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense may include variable  lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Finance lease expense consists of the  amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost  basis. Finance lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense. Concentration of Credit Risk. We provide advertising, marketing and corporate communications services to several thousand  clients that operate in nearly every industry sector of the global economy, and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal  course of business. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of  credit risk as our largest client accounted for 2.7% of revenue in 2022. Derivative Financial Instruments. All derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other  contracts, are recorded at fair value. Derivatives qualify for hedge accounting if: the hedging instrument is designated as a  hedge, the hedged exposure is specifically identifiable and exposes us to risk, and a change in fair value of the derivative financial  instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the hedged exposure have a high degree of correlation. The method of  assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness is formally documented. Hedge effectiveness is assessed, and  hedge ineffectiveness is measured at least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period. Changes in the fair value of a fair value  hedge are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment through results of operations.  Changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized  in results of operations. Foreign currency hedges of the net investment in our foreign operations are recorded in accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI. Any gain or loss will remain in AOCI until the complete or substantially complete  liquidation of our investment in the underlying operation. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Using  derivatives exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. We  manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific  minimum credit standards and other factors. Fair Value. We apply the fair value measurement guidance in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for  our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value and for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are  not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The  measurement of fair value requires the use of techniques based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect  market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. The inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: • Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; unadjusted quoted prices for identical  assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations with observable inputs. • Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. We use unadjusted quoted market prices to determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and classify such  items in Level 1. We use unadjusted quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and model-derived  valuations and classify such items in Level 2. In determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we consider certain market valuation adjustments that market  participants would consider in determining fair value, including: counterparty credit risk adjustments applied to financial assets and  liabilities, taking into account the actual credit risk of the counterparty when valuing assets measured at fair value and credit risk  adjustments applied to reflect our credit risk when valuing liabilities measured at fair value. 3.

Business Combinations In 2022, we completed five acquisitions that increased goodwill by $268.4 million. In addition, during 2022, we acquired  additional equity interests in certain majority owned subsidiaries, which are accounted for as equity transactions, and no additional  goodwill was recorded. None of the acquisitions in 2022, either individually or in the aggregate, was material to our results of  operations or financial position. The evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic  coverage, competitive position and service offerings, as well as our experience and judgment. Our acquisition strategy is focused  on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our strategic  business platforms and agency brands, through the expansion of their geographic area or their service capabilities to better serve  our clients. Certain acquisitions include an initial payment at closing and provide for future additional contingent purchase price  payments (earn-outs), which are derived using the performance of the acquired company and are based on predetermined formulas.  At December 31, 2022 and 2021, contingent purchase price obligations were $115.0 million and $167.1 million, respectively, of  which $39.2 million and $43.1 million, respectively, are recorded in other current liabilities. For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued  separately. We use several market participant measurements to determine fair value. This approach includes consideration of similar  and recent transactions, as well as utilizing discounted expected cash flow methodologies, and when available and as appropriate, we  use comparative market multiples to supplement our analysis. As is typical for most service businesses, a substantial portion of the  intangible asset value we acquire is the specialized know-how of the workforce, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not valued  separately. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the  related customer contracts, as well as trade names. One of the primary drivers in executing our acquisition strategy is the existence  of, or the ability to, expand our existing client relationships. The expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across  multiple agencies and regions.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

Debt Credit Facility and Credit Lines We have a $2.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a termination date of February 14,  2025. In addition, we have the ability to issue up to $2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated commercial paper and issue up to  the equivalent of $500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program. Certain of our international  subsidiaries have uncommitted credit lines aggregating $582.9 million, which are guaranteed by Omnicom. These facilities provide  additional liquidity sources for operating capital and general corporate purposes. During 2022, there were no borrowings under the  Credit Facility, and there were no commercial paper issuances. The Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of consolidated indebtedness to  consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash charges) of no more than 3.5 times  for the most recently ended 12-month period. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with this covenant as our Leverage  Ratio was 2.4 times. The Credit Facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. Short-T erm Debt Short-term debt of $16.9 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represented bank overdrafts  and short-term borrowings primarily of our international subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate was 10.3% and 1.6%,  respectively.

Segment Reporting Our branded agency networks operate in the advertising, marketing and corporate communications services industry, and  are organized into agency networks, virtual client networks, regional reporting units and operating groups or practice areas.  Our networks, virtual client networks and agencies increasingly share clients and provide clients with integrated services. The  main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs and direct service costs and occupancy  and other costs which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs and other overhead expenses. Therefore, given these  similarities, we aggregate our operating segments, which are our agency networks, into one reporting segment. The agency networks’ regional reporting units comprise three principal regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific.  The regional reporting units monitor the performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region. Agencies within the  regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries and in many cases the same clients and have similar economic  characteristics.

Share-Based Compensation Plans Share-based incentive awards are granted to employees under the 2021 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2021 Plan, which was  approved by the shareholders. The 2021 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or  the Compensation Committee. Awards include stock options, restricted stock and other performance-based stock awards. The  maximum number of shares of common stock that can be granted under the 2021 Plan is 14.7 million shares plus any shares  awarded under the 2021 Plan and any prior plan that have been forfeited or have expired. All awards reduce the number of shares  available for grant on a one-for-one basis. The terms of each award and the exercise date are determined by the Compensation  Committee. The 2021 Plan does not permit the holder of an award to elect cash settlement under any circumstances. At  December 31, 2022, there were 8,899,375 shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan. Share-based compensation expense was $81.7 million, $84.7 million and $70.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  At December 31, 2022, unamortized share-based compensation that will be expensed over the next five years is $196.5 million. We recognize a tax benefit in income tax expense and record a deferred tax asset for the share-based compensation expense  recognized for financial reporting purposes that has not been deducted on our income tax return. Excess tax benefits and  deficiencies represent the difference between the actual compensation deduction for tax purposes, which is calculated as the  difference between the grant date price of the award, and the price of our common stock on the vesting or exercise date. Any  excess tax benefit or deficiency related to share-based compensation is recorded in results of operations, as a component of income  tax expense, upon vesting of restricted stock awards or exercise of stock options. We recognized a tax benefit of $1.9 million and  $2.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Stock Options The exercise price of stock option awards cannot be less than 100% of the market price of our common stock on the grant  date and have a maximum contractual life of 10 years.

Restricted shares do not pay a dividend, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until the forfeiture  restrictions lapse. Under most circumstances, the employee forfeits the shares if employment ceases prior to the end of the  restriction period. Performance Restricted Stock Units The Compensation Committee grants certain employees performance restricted stock units, or PRSU. Each PRSU represents  the right to receive one share of common stock on vesting. The ultimate number of PRSUs received by the employee depends  on the Company’s average return on equity over a three year period compared to the average return on equity of a peer group  of principal competitors over the same period. The PRSUs vest three years from the grant date. The PRSUs have a service and  performance vesting condition and compensation expense is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. Over the performance period,  compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based on our estimate of the probability of achieving the performance  target for the portion of the awards subject to the performance vesting condition. We have assumed that all PRSUs will vest.

The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was  predominantly the result of the non-deductibility of the $113.4 million charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022, arising from  the effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as an additional increase in income tax expense of $4.8 million related to the disposition  of our businesses in Russia. These charges were partially offset by the tax benefit arising from our share-based compensation awards.  The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a nominal tax applied to the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media  discipline resulting from the excess of tax over book basis and a reduction in income tax expense of $32.8 million, primarily related  to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA imposes  a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, levies a 1% excise tax on net stock  repurchases after December 31, 2022, and provides tax incentives to promote clean energy. Historically, we have made discretionary  share repurchases. Beginning in 2023, these purchases would be subject to the excise tax. Based on the historical net repurchase  activity, the excise tax and the other provisions of the IRA are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or  financial position. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, imposed a one-time tax, the transition tax, on the accumulated  earnings of foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the remaining transition tax liability was $88.8 million and  $100.4 million, respectively. The transition tax is expected to be fully paid by 2026. The Tax Act also implemented a territorial  tax system that allows us to repatriate earnings of our foreign subsidiaries without incurring additional U.S. tax by providing a ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

While a territorial tax system limits U.S. federal income tax to domestic source income, foreign source  income is subject to tax in the appropriate foreign jurisdiction at the local rate, which in certain jurisdictions may be higher than  the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Therefore, the foreign tax rate differential will cause our effective tax rate to  be higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate. The international tax rate differentials in 2022 and 2021 are primarily  attributed to our earnings in Germany, Australia, France, Japan and Canada being taxed at higher rates than the U.S. statutory tax  rate. We have elected to account for any tax on the global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, in the period in which it is  incurred.

       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-25Substantially all the liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded in long-term liabilities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,  approximately $161.8 million and $157.3 million, respectively, of the liability for uncertain tax positions would affect our effective  tax rate upon resolution of the uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes $4.3 million, $2.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of interest, net  of tax benefit, and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns that have not been settled as of December 31, 2021. At  December 31, 2022 and 2021, accrued interest and penalties were $15.9 million and $10.7 million, respectively. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. Our  subsidiaries file tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions. Our principal foreign jurisdictions include the United Kingdom, France  and Germany. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of our U.S. federal tax returns through 2017. Tax  returns in the United Kingdom, France and Germany have been examined through 2020, 2018 and 2015, respectively. 12. Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits Defined Contribution Plans Our domestic and international subsidiaries provide retirement benefits for their employees primarily through defined  contribution profit sharing and savings plans. Contributions to the plans vary by subsidiary and have generally been in amounts up  to the maximum percentage of total eligible compensation of participating employees that is deductible for income tax purposes.  Contribution expense was $123.2 million, $115.5 million and $108.1 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Defined Benefit Pension Plans T wo of our U.S. businesses and several of our non-U.S. businesses sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans.  These plans provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings. The U.S. plans are subject  to ERISA and cover approximately 700 participants. These plans are closed to new participants and do not accrue future benefit  credits. The non-U.S. plans, which include statutory plans, are not subject to ERISA and cover approximately 7,300 participants. We have a Senior Executive Restrictive Covenant and Retention Plan, or Retention Plan, for certain executive officers selected  by the Compensation Committee. The Retention Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation severance plan that is not subject  to ERISA and was adopted to secure non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and ongoing consulting services from  such executive officers and to strengthen the retention aspect of executive officer compensation. The Retention Plan provides  annual payments upon termination following at least seven years of service with Omnicom or its subsidiaries to the participants  or to their beneficiaries. A participant’s annual benefit is payable for 15 consecutive calendar years following termination, but  in no event prior to age 55. The annual benefit is equal to the lesser of (i) the participant’s final average pay times an applicable  percentage, which is based upon the executive’s years of service as an executive officer, not to exceed 35% or (ii) $1.5 million  adjusted for cost-of-living, beginning with the second annual payment, not to exceed 2.5% per year. The Retention Plan is not  funded and benefits are paid when due.

A total  return investment approach using a mix of equities and fixed income investments maximizes the long-term return. This strategy is  intended to minimize plan expense by achieving long-term returns in excess of the growth in plan liabilities over time. The discount  rate used to compute net periodic benefit cost is based on yields of available high-quality bonds and reflects the expected cash  flow as of the measurement date. The expected returns on plan assets and discount rates for the non-U.S. plans are based on local  factors, including each plan’s investment approach, local interest rates and plan participant profiles. Experience gains and losses and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are generally amortized over a period no longer  than the expected average future service of active employees. Our funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements in accordance with the  applicable employee benefit and tax laws that the plans are subject to, plus such additional amounts as we may determine to be  appropriate. In 2022 and 2021, we contributed $8.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively, to the defined benefit pension plans.  We do not expect the contributions for 2023 to differ materially from the 2022 contributions.

Temporary Equity – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Owners of noncontrolling equity interests in some of our subsidiaries have the right in certain circumstances to require us to  purchase all or a portion of their equity interest at fair value as defined in the applicable agreements. Assuming that the subsidiaries  perform at their current and projected profit levels, at December 31, 2022, the aggregate estimated amount we could be required to  pay in future periods is $382.9 million, of which $145.1 million is currently exercisable by the holders. If these rights are exercised,  there would be an increase in net income attributable to Omnicom as a result of our increased ownership interest and the reduction  of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The ultimate amount paid could be significantly different because the  redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the subject businesses, the timing of the exercise of these rights  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Upon redemption, the difference between the estimated redemption value and the  actual amount paid is recorded in additional paid-in capital. 18. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. We do not expect that these proceedings will  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

The  estimated fair value of the contingent purchase price obligations is calculated in accordance with the terms of each acquisition  agreement and is discounted. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices. 21. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of  derivative financial instruments. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility  arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We use net investment hedges to manage the volatility of foreign exchange rates  on the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Using derivatives  exposes us to the risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. We manage that  risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit  standards and other factors. We evaluate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market risks on our  derivatives. We periodically determine the potential loss from market risk on our derivatives by performing a value-at-risk, or  VaR, analysis. VaR is a statistical model that uses historical currency exchange rate data to measure the potential impact on future  earnings of our derivative financial instruments assuming normal market conditions. The VaR model is not intended to represent  actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Based on the results of the model, we estimate with 95%  confidence a maximum one-day change in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2022 was not  significant. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk As an integral part of our global treasury operations, we centralize our cash and use notional multicurrency pools to manage  the foreign currency exchange risk that arises from imbalances between subsidiaries and their respective treasury centers. In  addition, there are circumstances where revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the same currency. In these  instances, amounts are either promptly settled or hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts. To manage this risk, we  had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $40.3 million and $77.3 million at  December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OMNICOM GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)F-33Foreign currency derivatives are designated as fair value hedges; therefore, any gain or loss in fair value incurred on those  instruments is recorded in results of operations and is generally offset by decreases or increases in the fair value of the underlying  exposure. By using these financial instruments, we reduce financial risk of adverse foreign exchange changes by foregoing any gain  which might occur if the markets move favorably. The terms of our forward foreign exchange contracts are generally less than  90 days. In 2022, we entered into fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps with a notional value of $150 million to hedge a portion of the  net investment in our Japanese subsidiaries against volatility in the Yen/U.S. Dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and  qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2025 and 2029. Changes in the fair  value of the swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  (loss), or AOCI. Any gain or loss will remain in AOCI until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment  in the underlying operations. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot  exchange rates. We receive net fixed U.S. Dollar interest payments, and in 2022, we recorded $1.2 million as a reduction of interest  expense. At December 31, 2022, the liability for the swap fair value was $16.5 million and is recorded in long-term liabilities. Interest Rate Risk We may use interest rate swaps to manage our interest cost and structure our long-term debt portfolio to achieve a mix of  fixed rate and floating rate debt. During 2022, there were no interest rate swaps and, at December 31, 2022, long-term debt  consisted entirely of fixed-rate debt. 22. New Accounting Standards On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With  Customers, or ASU 2021-08, that requires acquiring companies to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and  contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination consistent with those recorded by the  acquiring company. Contracts with customers in the advertising and marketing business are typically short duration contracts. To  the extent we acquire companies in the advertising and marketing communications business, the adoption of this standard will not  have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 23. Subsequent Events We have evaluated events subsequent to the balance sheet date and determined there have not been any events that have  occurred that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/OmnicomGroup_2022.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

For the second year  in a row,  we delivered  double -digit  organic  growth  and record -high financials,  with  Q4 well  ahead of expectations.   Today,  the profound transformation we have  been  through means  our business  is firing  on all cylinders,  allowing   us to outperform  the market  once  again on every  KPI.    Thanks  to our data  and technology  capabilities,  which now  represent  a third of our revenue,  we have  been  able  to  continue  to capture  the shift  in our clients’  spend  towards  first party  data management,  commerce  and business   transformation. This can be seen  in Epsilon  and Publicis  Sapient’s  annual  numbers,  with  organic growth  of +12%   and +19%  respectively.  That  dynamic has also boosted  our creative  and media  business,  and is reflected  in all of  our regions,  with  the U.S. at +10%,  APAC  at +6.5%  and Europe  at +12.3%  for the year.    Our go-to-market,  positioning Publicis  as a key partner  in our clients’  transformation,  means  we have  won  more   than our share  of new  business  opportunities,  and topped the rankings  for the fourth  time  in the past  five years.    Last but not least,  our unique  platform  organization,  with  our global  delivery centres,  our shared services  and our  country  model,  powe red by Marcel,  allowed  us to deliver  best  in class  financial  ratios  while  maintaining record - high bonuses  and rewarding everyone  in our group. Our operating margin  rate came  in at 18.0%,  free cash flow   at 1.7 billion  euros,  while  our headline  EPS grew  by 26%, allowing  us to propose  a dividend of 2.90 euros  per share.   This same  revenue  mix,  go-to-market,  and platform  organization make  us confident  for the year  ahead,  despite   the continued  macroeconomic challenges.  In 2023,  we expect  to sustain  the momentum  we have  built  since  the  pandemic,  delivering  3 to 5% organic growth,  in line with  our 3-year  CAGR,  while  maintaining an industry -leading  operating margin  between  17.5%  and 18%.     None  of this would be possible  without  the trust  of our clients  and the outstanding efforts  of our people,  who  I’d  like to deeply  and sincerely  thank  for everything we have  achieved together  so far.”              *  *      *    ', metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/PublicisGroupe_2022.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

EBITDA  was 22.3% as a percentage of net revenue (compared to 22. 1% in 202 1).    • Personnel costs  totaled 8,211 million euros in 2022 , up by 23.7% from 6, 639 million euros in 2021 . As a  percentage of net revenue, the personnel expenses represented 65.3% in 2022 , compared to 63 .3% in  2021 . Fixed personnel costs were 7,109 million euros represent ing 56.5% of net revenue versus 5 4.6% in  2021 . The cost of freelancers rose by 64 million euros in 2022 , representing 456 million euros. Restructuring  costs reached 82  million euros , up from the low 2021  level of 53  million euros .     • Other operating costs (excluding depreciation & amortization) amounted to 3,184  million euros, compared  to 2,782 million euros in 2021 . This represent ed 25.3% of net revenue compared to 26.5%  in 202 1. The  agile structure of the Groupe allowed to contain G&A costs in a context of top line increase. In addition, the accounting treatment linked to the renewal of two large outdoor media contracts for 5 and 10 years, as  mentioned in 2021 accounts, resulted i n a technical c. 75 basis point impact, entirely offset in depreciation;  those contracts were accounted for as cost of sales in 2021 , and are  now accounted for as right of use and  lease liability leading to depreciation.    Depreciation and amortization expense was 535 million euros in 2022 , up 58 million euros  compared to 2021 .  This increase reflects  the combination of foreign exchange rates  and the offsetting of the Outdoor Media contract  renewal described above, partly mitigated by our actions over the last years to optimize our real estate footprint .   The operating margin  amounted to 2 ,266 million euros, up + 23.2% compared to 202 1. This represents a margin  rate of 18.0%, up 50 basis points from 17 .5% in 2021 .     Operating margin rates were  18.8%  in North America, 16.1%  in Europe, 21.2%  in Asia -Pacific, 8.7%  in Latin  America and 14.2%  in the Middle East Africa region.    Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions  totaled  287 million euro in 2022 , up from 256 million euros   in 2021 . Impairment losses amounted to 109 million euros  (122 million euros in 2021), essentially related  to the real  estate consolidation plan \"All in One\", which leads to a reduction in the number of sites, while allowing better collaboration between the teams. In addition, net non- current income is negative at  103 million euros in 2022   (versus a negative 28 million euros in 2021 ), including  an 87 million euros loss linked to the Groupe’s exit from  Russia as announced in March 2022.

It included 102 million euros of interest largely related to Epsilon’s acquisition debt, partly mitigated  by interest income of 85 million euros, a 71 million euros increase compared to 2021,  reflec ting higher cash  balances and interest rates, in particular in the U.S.    • Other financial income and expenses were a charge of 100 million euros in 2022, notably composed by 87   million euros interest on lease liabilities and 9 million in income from the fair value remeasurement of Mutual  Funds. In 2021, other finan cial income and expenses were a charge of 33  million euros, notably composed  of 70 million euros interest on lease liabilities and 4 2 million in income from the fair value remeasurement  of Mutual Funds.     The revaluation of earn- out payments amounted to a loss of 2 million euros compared to a gain  of 27 million euros  in 2021 .

The health and protection of employees remained a constant concern throughout 2022 in view of the health situation in each country; a large majority of the Groupe's employees continued to work from home, while a hybrid  organizational model was also put in place, alternating between te lecommuting and office work in many agencies.  The services implemented during the pandemic to help everyone cope with physical and psychological fatigue have been continued and integrated into the local healthcare offer accessible to all, to enable better mental and physical  health.    #WorkWithCancer   In January 2023, Publicis  launched the #WorkWithCancer  program, to better support employees facing the illness  or those who become a caregiver for a loved one. This program is based on the mobilization of Publicis Groupe  and leaders of other major companies on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos , each of them  signing a charter around 4 commitments:   \\uf0a7 Secure the salary of employees affected by illness for at least one year;   \\uf0a7 Offer employees concerned individualized support to help them manage their professional and personal  difficulties;   \\uf0a7 Create an i nternal community of people directly or indirectly affected by the disease within the company;   \\uf0a7 Allow employees who are caregivers to have access to individualized support to help them cope with this  complicated period.     Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  In Ukraine, the employee fundraising campaign and its matching by Publicis Groupe raised 750,000 euros, half of  which has already been used to support some thirty employees who have suffered very serious material damage. The Groupe has decided to continue payi ng the salaries of local teams in 2023, as it did in 2022.    2022 was an important year in terms of sharing value with employees, with all employees who do not receive a bonus and have a certain length of service receiving an additional week's salary on two occasions: in April 2022 for  exceptional results in 2021, and in November 2022 to cope with the inflationary context, for a shared total of 85 million euros.    The Groupe's objective of having 45% women in key leadership positions by 2025, with a transition point of 42% by 2022, is on track . In the United States, the United Kingdom, France, India and many other countries, efforts have  continued to focus on more open and inclusive recruitment, in particular through various initiatives in favor of young peopl e who are far removed from our businesses, with several programs, such as the MCTP for the 14 th year in the  United States and Publicis Track  in France.    \", metadata={'source': 'annual_reports/PublicisGroupe_2022.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

The members of the ESG Committee and the members of the Supervisory Board who so wished have received  training on climate issues in order to better understand the challenges in this area. As an extension of the work  carried out in the ar ea of climate risk analysis, an internal Climate Task Force has been set up to anticipate the  various issues by aligning itself with the IPCC scenarios and their evolution.    Viva la Difference   For the third year, the Viva la Difference internal seminar brought together virtually all of the Groupe's employees in December 2022 to take stock of this singular year and to look ahead to 2023. Employees logged on to Marcel  to  follow this  three- day event  in a digital format, with live sessions from New York and speakers from around the world.  This seminar provided an opportunity to detail the Groupe's strategic ambitions in terms of Creative Commerce and  its application across the Groupe's various busines ses and practices, by addressing the new offers proposed to  clients. The creative aspect of the event was also highlighted with the presentation of the CannesDoAwards to reward the best campaigns selected by employee vote. The seminar was followed by a day  of internal round- table  discussions in each region to allow the Top Management to answer all the employees' questions at length.\", metadata={'page': 15, 'source': 'annual_reports/PublicisGroupe_2022.pdf'}),\n",

The health and protection of employees remained a constant concern throughout 2022 in view of the health situation in each country; a large majority of the Groupe's employees continued to work from home, while a hybrid  organizational model was also put in place, alternating between te lecommuting and office work in many agencies.  The services implemented during the pandemic to help everyone cope with physical and psychological fatigue have been continued and integrated into the local healthcare offer accessible to all, to enable better mental and physical  health.    #WorkWithCancer   In January 2023, Publicis  launched the #WorkWithCancer  program, to better support employees facing the illness  or those who become a caregiver for a loved one. This program is based on the mobilization of Publicis Groupe  and leaders of other major companies on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos , each of them  signing a charter around 4 commitments:   \\uf0a7 Secure the salary of employees affected by illness for at least one year;   \\uf0a7 Offer employees concerned individualized support to help them manage their professional and personal  difficulties;   \\uf0a7 Create an i nternal community of people directly or indirectly affected by the disease within the company;   \\uf0a7 Allow employees who are caregivers to have access to individualized support to help them cope with this  complicated period.     Diversity, Equity & Inclusion  In Ukraine, the employee fundraising campaign and its matching by Publicis Groupe raised 750,000 euros, half of  which has already been used to support some thirty employees who have suffered very serious material damage\", metadata={'page': 13, 'source': 'annual_reports/PublicisGroupe_2022.pdf'}),\n",
